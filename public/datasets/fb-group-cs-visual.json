Within your presentation, include a storyboard showing the dynamics of your visualization from beginning to end  (i.e.  how one logs in, how transitions occur, etc.)\n\nPlease follow the following structure:\n\n- describe the motivation for creating this visualization\n- describe the intended audience for this visualization\n- describe the main questions/problems you plan to answer/understand with this visualization\n- describe the tools, analysis you will need to help answer your questions\n- in the storyboard, show the visualization flow from beginning to end.\n\nThis portion of the project is as much about communication as it is about the design and idea.  The designs will be graded using the following rubric:\n\n1.  did you present the above 5 sections in your proposal  (5/100)  \n2.  is the problem you are addressing clear  (15/100)  \n3.  is the approach you are using to address this problem clear (15/100)  \n4.  does your design answer your question (20/100) \n6.  does the storyboard present a clear and cogent presentation of your story - does it have a coherent organization and flow (20/100) \n6.  is your approach and/or design novel (15/100)\n7.  did you incorporate material presented in class or from the readings (10/100)\n\nI would encourage all of you to include visuals sooner in your presentations.  I also recommend not putting whole paragraphs on the slides.  If you want to include more information for peer studio evaluation, feel free to add comments in the notes area of the slides.  Also, please include more explicitly how the class material influenced your design or data set.\n\nPlease include a link to your design (ppt, pdf, or your choice of media) in your peer studio submission.  Only 1 member of each team needs to submit - please include the names of *all* the members in your presentation.\nFor class, please bring computer dongles so you can  present from your own machine.  Most students in the past have preferred this.\n(Note:  No implementation is required for the design.  A good design now will help you as you work on implementations later in class.)", "type": "status", "id": "540171036091887_610346655740991"}, {"from": {"id": "832080106", "name": "Jarai Carter"}, "comments": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZOakV3TWpjMk1ERTFOelE0TURVMU9qRTBNVEUwTXpVMU5UZz0=", "before": "WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZOakV3TURjd05UUTFOelk0TmpBeU9qRTBNVEUwTURNME56az0="}}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "755463206", "name": "Ola Giwa"}, "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": "2014-09-22T16:31:19+0000", "message": "http://pages.vassar.edu/theories-of-the-novel/files/2013/04/Metaphors-We-Live-By.pdf", "id": "610070545768602"}, {"from": {"id": "728525023", "name": "Karrie G.
